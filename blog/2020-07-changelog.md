From the archives I was summoned to bring thee.... this ancient changelog.

### Summary

* Added support for rendering shadow sprites on existing units
* Reworked the asset exporter to eliminate translation errors and streamline the Assets folder's structure automatically
* Added functionality to automatically adjust unit sprites based on their position relative to the camera
* Introduced framework to support management and rendering of attached sprites for known units

### Lessons learned

* Managing the assets pipeline is a major pain and likely requires more thought than I gave it
* 2.5D interactions are an unexpected source of major headache, with no great solution I could find
