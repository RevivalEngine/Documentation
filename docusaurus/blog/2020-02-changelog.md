From the archives I was summoned to bring thee.... this ancient changelog.

### Summary

* Added debug menu to more easily control the various rendering options
* Streamlined the UI code to work with an addon-like interface system

### Lessons learned

At this time, debugging graphics issues and creating Widgets from code became much easier.

* Always create a debug menu first. It's incredibly helpful in debugging visual artifacts
* Extension-based systems are awesome, if they've been designed like this from the start
* Creating a widget-based UI system is a lot more work than one would think
