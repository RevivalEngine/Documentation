From the archives I was summoned to bring thee.... this ancient changelog.

### Summary

* Implemented EditorService prototype to allow running the WebClient in different modes
* UI prototyping to refine the existing UI code

### Lessons learned

* UI wireframes can be extremely helpful in narrowing down the requirements
* Introducing microservices when you don't *really* need them is ill-advised
