From the archives I was summoned to bring thee.... this ancient changelog.

### Summary

* Mostly just some streamlining, refactoring and documentation efforts

### Lessons learned

Nothing too exciting as there was precious little time. Painfully obvious lessons, but still:

* Maintaining even the semblance of a readable codebase is a *ton* of work
* It's similarly difficult to anticipate how much time documentation actually takes
