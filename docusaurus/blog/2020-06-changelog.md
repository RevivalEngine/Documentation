From the archives I was summoned to bring thee.... this ancient changelog.

### Summary

* Extended debug menu to allow managing known units (and their animation state) more easily
* Designed initial version of the on-the-fly converter system that would later become standardized
* Added basic support for fog effects, dynamic lights, and water planes to the rendering API

### Lessons learned

* 2D animations can become quite annoying if there are many moving parts
* Processing binary files and converting them to a usable format turned out to be easier than expected
